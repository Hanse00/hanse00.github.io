      <title>Apple Vision Pro</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Earlier today I had an appointment at the Apple Store to demo the company’s newest product, the Apple Vision Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re not up to speed, the Apple Vision Pro is an AR&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; headset that you wear, it has cameras and other sensors on the front, and small screens and lenses on the inside that you look at. The result is a convincing facsimile of the whole device being “see through”, with the notable exception that the software then allows you to interact with applications, which to you appear like they’re floating in the room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple has a few videos on their site you can view to get a sense for what the device can do at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.apple.com/apple-vision-pro/guided-tour/&#34;&gt;https://www.apple.com/apple-vision-pro/guided-tour/&lt;/a&gt;, that being said video truly does not do the experience justice. I would highly recommend anyone who’s the least bit curious to give this a go, worst case scenario you spend 30 minutes doing something different with your day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me the experience felt truly magical, in ways that technology hasn’t done for me in a while. The illusion was totally able to trick my brain into feeling like the apps were just floating there in space. The eye tracking (which is used like a cursor on a computer) is really good. It felt effortless to look at the button I wanted to tap. I walked away from the whole thing breath taken, and &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; tempted to buy one on the spot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately for my marriage sense prevailed, because the $3,500 price tag for the base model isn’t the kind of thing you buy and &lt;em&gt;then&lt;/em&gt; tell your wife about (at least not in my family), but I can absolutely see the appeal.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

    alt=&#34;Second photo of myself wearing the Vision Pro, this time looking more directly towards the camera.&#34;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I wore my &lt;a href=&#34;https://hypercritical.co&#34;&gt;Hypercritical&lt;/a&gt; shirt for the occasion.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As someone who wears glasses, I was nervous about what that situation would look like at the store. I had taken a questionnaire at the time of booking, but it didn’t ask any specifics about my prescription, so I wasn’t sure what to expect on that front.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out that when you come in, they take your glasses and scan them on a machine. A little while later an employee comes out with the headset, already fitted with the correct lenses for you. But… how do they make sure they have your lenses? After all prescriptions come in many kinds. I was told that for this purpose, the individual Apple Store has over 860 different pairs of lenses sitting in the back room, to fit almost anyone right then and there in time for the demo. Mind blown.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Triple Booting macOS, Ubuntu, and Windows</title>
      <link>/blog/triple-booting-macos-ubuntu-and-windows/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Back in 2015, whilst I was still a student, I had a part time job at the educational institution I attended. As is too often the case, we had severe budgetary constraints, a lack of goodwill from upper management, and conflicting desires between the professors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Determined not to be defeated, my manager and I came up with a plan so audacious, that it might just work: We’d install macOS, Ubuntu, and Windows, all on the same physical Apple Mac mini devices. Effectively getting three computers for the cost of one, allowing every professor to have their system of choice, yet coming in at a price just low enough that we could sway the principal to give us the budget.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether that plan was the right choice, is a topic for another day. It seemed to be the best course of action for us to take at the time. And so we embarked on the journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If memory serves me right, I put down a grand total of ~300 hours on my worksheet during the course of the project. Most of which was spent researching on- and offline, getting intimately familiar with Apple’s EFI implementation (For better or worse), wiping the poor hard drive over and over again, each time learning something new that wouldn’t work. I lost count of how many times I concluded the task was impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If not for &lt;a href=&#34;http://davidlively.com/notes/macbook-pro-triple-boot/&#34;&gt;a blog post by David Lively&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, I’m confident my manager would have accepted my defeat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By some combination of skill, luck, and trying for the umpteenth time, we did eventually get the desired result.
Looking back at it today, I’m not sure if I’m proud, or ashamed of the frankenmachine we created, but we did it. And for a few years after I left that place, it kept doing what it needed to do.&lt;/p&gt;

    alt=&#34;A picture of the rEFInd boot screen, displaying the three OS logos to select which you wish to boot.&#34;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The end result: a boot screen where you can select which of the available OS&amp;rsquo;es you wish to load.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to the mountain of unknowns I met when trying to solve the problem, I had decided early on that it had to be documented. If we ever did get it working, I wanted to be sure I knew how.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently I found that old PDF file, and was determined to share it forward. Just as David guided me on my way, I hope this can help anyone who wants to go down the same path. Keep in mind that much has changed since 2015, for one Apple introduced &lt;a href=&#34;https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208862&#34;&gt;the T2&lt;/a&gt; which might just make this impossible&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also want to apologize for the numerous spelling and grammatical mistakes in the document, but as I have no access to any original material, it will have to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do be warned, here be dragons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t know who this person is, but I owe them a debt of gratitude. This blog was the only semblance of help I found in my online research.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:2&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least without disabling various security features.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
