For as long as I can remember, I've been worrying about my legacy.

As a child learning the history of so many who came before me, I always wondered what there would be to say about me when it was all said and done.
Would I one day be a great physist?[^1] Would I be immortalised on the periodic table by uncovering a new element?

When I haphasardly fell into computing instead, I had dreams of being compared to Linus Torvalds and Richard Stallman[^2] one day.
Of creating software so remarkably useful that it would solidify my name in computing history.

But the harsh truth is that for every person history remembers, millions are quietly forgotten. The odds are not on my side, in the grand scheme of what *we* have been doing on this globe for the past hundred-thousand years, it's not likely that anything I do will matter *that* much.

Worse still, as the people that shaped my life begin to dissapear[^3], it becomes increasingly clear to me that it's damn near impossible for any of us to truly *know* one another in life. I've come to learn many things about their lives, the lives *I* was a part of, that I simply didn't see in the haze of living life through my own lense.

If that's the case, what chance do we have of knowing someone after they're dead? What chance do we have of being remembered for who we were?

None.

The truth is we don't even really know ourselves. Everything I remember I do through the rose-tintented glasses of nostalgia, the innocence of youth, and the stories I've been telling myself.

I no longer know the young guy who started a job at Google in 2016, and felt like he was the absolute shit for making it to the big leagues so early in his career.

The teenager who fell in love with his first girlfriend, and was so unprepared for the emotional rollercoaster of love and rejection, is now someone I can smile at as I recall how he felt. But it took years from being the person that had those experiences, to becoming a person that could look at them as an outside observer.

And what about the 10 year old kid who had his whole world uprooted, when his mother got a job in the city and so they moved from the country to the suburbs? As I recall, he was absolutely shattered about losing the life he knew. He loved his small town, but would he still have loved it a decade later if it had become a barrier to his career prospects in the future? We will never know, because that me never got to exist.

This might all feel like a rather lengthy digression, but I think there's something important here: Maybe the idea of legacy doesn't even make sense, if there's no constant self. After all, in the thought "I want to be remembered", the *I* is rather central.

My dear son, you are my seed. Proverbially and literally, I planted you in this garden we call earth. And as I keep thinking about my legacy, these days my mind turns straight to you.

I hope for no greather honor than to see my son grow into a man of his own, and perhaps care *a little* about who his old man was. I hope some of these ramblings I leave behind will be helpful in painting the picture of who I was, when eventually this is all that will be left of me.

[^1]: Physics were my first passion in school, and for a while it seemed I may pursue it for a living.

[^3]: I first lost my grandmother Urszula Mikulska in 2015. My grandfather Ove Hansen passed in the spring of 2022. My aunt Dorota Mikulska in the fall of 2024. I met two of my great-grandmothers, but they both died at an early enough time in my life that it didn't really *matter* to me in the same way.
