I recently woke up from a stress dream involving my time at Google[^1], and as I came to, I only felt increasingly stressed at the realization that I'm starting to forget many of the events and faces that so greatly influenced those years of my life.

Indeed my time at Google from 2016 to 2018 was in many ways the foundation of my life as an adult, so although forgetting is only a natural part of the human condition, I want to take this opportunity to remember, and thank, those people who left their mark on me.

[^1]: I will let you imagine why one might be stressed in the spring of 2025.

## Angelique

Angelique belongs at the top of this list, not because of the alphabet[^2], but because she was the first link between me and Google.

[^2]: Not to be confused with [Alphabet](https://abc.xyz) of course.

## Shannon

Shannon was a friend to all the people of [Techstop](https://youtu.be/SGYns3cC4YY). I can't recall a single time she didn't bring positivity to a situation, despite many that didn't truly warrant it.
She always brought a genuine (At least I *think* they were genuine) smile to the workplace, and that helped a lot.

Shannon is also one of few people who I've stayed in touch with since, though we don't speak often, I cherish her friendship when we do. It's ultimately what lead me to decide to write these things down.

## Fabiano

Fabiano was my first manager at Google, and in fact my first *real* manager of any kind. I didn't know what to expect of a manager back then, but Fabiano ticked all the boxes.

He way always honest, upfront, and supportive as a manager. When I messed up, I knew, but I wasn't chastised. I've come to appreciate just how difficult of a skill that is over the years.

With Fabiano at the helm, our team truly felt like a collaborative enterprise in bringing the very best to our fellow Googlers.



## Fabio

Yeah, we had both a Fabio and a Fabiano on the team, it lead to many a joke at their expense.

Fabio was a strong engineer, he lead the first internal project I got myself involved in, my first foray into the world of professional software engineering.

After Fabio left our team to become a real honest [SRE](https://sre.google), I remember once running into him at the elevator and uttering something like "Bro your code is shit!".
I was frustrated with a bug I was working on, it was supposed to come across humorous, but I don't think it did. I regret that to this day.

Fabio, thank you for the work you did for all Techstops worldwide. I will never forget what we built together. Sitting here now thinking about how proud I am to have been part of the project,
I'm honestly tearing up a bit.
