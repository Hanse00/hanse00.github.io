      <title>Senseless Policy</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The world is full of laws, policies, and rules that fall apart at the slightest iterrogation. Today I was met with one of those.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found myself at Best Buy returning a recently purchased power strip because it didn&amp;rsquo;t fulfil my needs. Specifically it had 12 plugs, but the layout was such that in reality only one pair of 6, or the other 6, could be used at any particular time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After handling the return, which involved no questions beyond &amp;ldquo;Did you open it?&amp;rdquo;, and resulted in a full refund to my credit card, I decided to go see if I could find an alternate model that would do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found a new strip that, based on the box art, seemed like it had more margin between plugs such that I could actually use them simultaneously. But having been recently burned I found a store employee, and asked if he&amp;rsquo;d mind opening the box so I could check out the product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The employee in question, undoubtly &lt;em&gt;just following policy&lt;/em&gt; checked the box, and confirmed that we could have a look but only because there was no tape in our way. Had there been, we would have been unable to open the box together because that would turn the product into &amp;ldquo;open box&amp;rdquo; inventory (Which gets sold for slightly less).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the surface that &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; sound like a reaonable policy, but after just a moment of thought it should be obvious that, had the employee not allowed me to inspect the product, I could simply: Buy it, open the box after completing the transaction, decide I didn&amp;rsquo;t want it, and get an immediate refund.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only would that leave the store with the same piece of opened inventory, but they&amp;rsquo;d also be out the credit card processing fees involved in charging and refunding me. Not to mention giving me a worse customer service interaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a great little example of why it&amp;rsquo;s so important that we think about the whole when we engage with designing and building systems, and consider the outcomes in aggregate. Someone probably thought it was a reasonable policy to say &amp;ldquo;We shouldn&amp;rsquo;t open products&amp;rdquo;, but in totality it flies in the face of &amp;ldquo;We should make money by selling products to customers&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Independence Day</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://werd.io/2024/the-america-that-i-love&#34;&gt;Ben Werdmuller writes&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s an America I’m delighted to be a part of; one that I’ve come to truly love. It’s the America that understands the impact it’s had and has, both on its own communities and on the world, and genuinely wants to do much better. &amp;hellip; It’s not the only America, and it’s not the loudest America. But it’s the best one, by far. I think it’s worth saying that I do love it; I want to support it; I want it to be the defining experience of being in and from this country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like Ben, I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about America today, and my relationship with this nation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was not born on America&amp;rsquo;s shores, nor with any particular attachment to this land. Yet due to the happy little accidents called life, I find myself siting here now, celebrating this Independence Day as a bona fide American Citizen for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are countless things wrong with our nation, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t possible itemize them here for fear of implying that those faults I left out were on purpose, and mean less to me. It&amp;rsquo;s truly overwhelming just how much work we have ahead of us to live up to the ideals of Liberty, Justice, Freedom, and Independence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My mind drifts to the following lines from the musical &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamilton_(musical)&#34;&gt;Hamilton&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aaron Burr: The constitution&amp;rsquo;s a mess.&lt;br&gt;
Alexander Hamilton: So it needs amendments.&lt;br&gt;
Aaron Burr: It&amp;rsquo;s full of contradictions.&lt;br&gt;
Alexander Hamilton: So is independence. We have to start somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For all of its numerous faults, I truly believe that today&amp;rsquo;s America is that &lt;em&gt;somewhere&lt;/em&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s far from perfect, but we&amp;rsquo;ve got a start. We &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; make this the America that lives up to our lofty ideals, but we&amp;rsquo;re going to have to fight for it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Speaking Isn&#39;t Mandatory</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The internet era is marked by many things, but the sheer speed and volume of communication stands out to me as perhaps the most significant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s always a new story breaking somewhere. When everything from wars to simple disagreements in our communities are played out on a public stage for all the world to see, there’s no moment devoid of topics we are each expected to take a stance on. Who rightfully deserves to win the war? Are you in favor of oppression or free speech? Surely you don’t support &lt;em&gt;those&lt;/em&gt; people? Not speaking out may not seem like an option, after all if you don’t condemn bad things, you must implicitly support them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This fear of being seen as someone who doesn’t care, or worse even outright supports bad things, can drive us to quickly adopt a posture. The problem is that we miss so much of the nuance of the world, in our rush to an opinion. The unfortunate truth is that we people have a tendency to have complicated motivations, which drive us to take actions with second and third order effects we never considered. It doesn’t help that our globally intertwined economy is too complex for any one person to really grasp the full picture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A boon in our economy good, but if that money is spent on products that ultimately support nations that oppress their citizens, suddenly it’s bad again. Lowering emissions is great, but hardworking folks no longer being able to support their families is of course not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Am I advocating that we can never have any opinions? Absolutely not, public discourse is a cornerstone of any functional society. If we don’t discuss our thoughts, we will never grow beyond ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I am saying is this: It’s okay not to speak when you’re not ready to. Sometimes you need to listen to others. Sometimes an issue is so far outside of your domain that you simply don’t have anything to say. And sometimes you need to reflect on a matter before you make up your mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of those things are alright, speaking up every single time is not mandatory.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
