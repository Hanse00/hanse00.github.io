I saw a [post](https://esq.social/@andrew/114291732804093458) earlier today by [Andrew Leahey](https://leahey.org) advertising that he'd added a [Now](https://nownownow.com/about) page to his site.
This was the first I came across the concept, but it seemed like a fun idea, so I've now [added one to this site]({{< relref "../now.md" >}}) as well.
