Over the course of the past couple of days, I've migrated this blog from Squarespace to [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). In so doing, I had to review each of the existing posts, as part of the conversion process.

What I found was, frankly, embarrassment.

[I'm aware of my lacking writing abilities]({{< ref "publish-whatever-you-want" >}}), but nothing makes that quite as clear as re-reading something you wrote a while back.

As I sat with my embarrassment, I considered deleting some of those old posts and giving myself a clean slate. Ultimately though, I decided to accept my shame as a sign of growth.

Yes, my past writing is worse than I'd like it to be. Hopefully my future writing will be better, but I accept that being bad at something is the first step on the journey to getting good.
