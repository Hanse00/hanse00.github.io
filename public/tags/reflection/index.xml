      <title>A Reflection on 2023</title>
      <link>/blog/a-reflection-on-2023/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 31 Dec 2023 18:22:41 -0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/blog/a-reflection-on-2023/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;On the last day of 2022, exactly one year ago, I wrote a blog post titled “&lt;a href=&#34;https://philip.mallegolhansen.com/blog/a-reflection-on-2022/&#34;&gt;A reflection on 2022&lt;/a&gt;”. The opening of that post features a slight mockery of the human tendency to assign value to arbitrary factors we ourselves have decided, such as the beginning and ending of a year on the Gregorian calendar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intellectually I stand by that thought today. It is odd that we have evolved to put such importance in things that, objectively, carry no importance at all. But that is not to say that I believe myself to be above this tendency, as evident by this post appearing exactly 1 Gregorian year after the past one, and given that it’s happening twice in a row, I suppose that officially makes this a tradition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So welcome, to the &lt;em&gt;annual&lt;/em&gt; reflection of the year that passed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;pregnancy&#34; &gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#pregnancy&#34;&gt;
        #
    &lt;/a&gt;
    Pregnancy
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I sat here a year ago, I wrote about the brevity of life, particular in the context of losing my beloved grandfather. This year the tidal way of life flows in the opposite direction, as my wife and I managed to get pregnant with a child of our own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I imagine I’ll have many things to write about fatherhood, particularly in the context of raising a child in a digital age as a technology enthusiasts and professional. Many of the things that were true in my own youth are remarkably different today, and I’m already fretting over these issues in the back of my mind: When do you give them a phone? How do you enable them to participate online without forfeiting their privacy, when they’re still too young to appreciate the implications of the decisions? But there will be plenty of opportunities for me to remark on those things later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now I am endlessly grateful that my wife continues to be healthy, and I hope with all my heart to become a great father to a happy, healthy, child in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;online-presence&#34; &gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#online-presence&#34;&gt;
        #
    &lt;/a&gt;
    Online Presence
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year I wrote that the fall of X (née Twitter) had inspired in me a new hope for what the web could be. I’m happy to be able to say that I followed through on that hope, at least to some degree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I completed and published 6 individual posts (not including this one) on this site in the last year. And while I drafted an additional ~16 that haven’t seen the light of day&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, I’m incredibly pleased with myself that I did the 6 that I did. Some progress is infinitely more than no progress, and though I’m the kind of person to lose sight of that, this past year has reinforced that it’s important to celebrate the wins you do get.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m also excited about the feedback I’ve gotten. When I first started, I was worried that it was going to be an impossible battle to get anyone to click the link and actually go to my site. There’s a lot of talk about social media silos these days, and whether it’s even possible to drag people out of them, but at least for my very small sample size, my analytics seem to suggest that people actually did browse my page from time to time. So all hope for the web is not lost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;living-intentionally&#34; &gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#living-intentionally&#34;&gt;
        #
    &lt;/a&gt;
    Living Intentionally
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my draft posts from earlier in the year speaks to the fact that you cannot do everything - In a somewhat ironic twist I suppose, at the time I ended up deciding that finishing that post was one of the things I didn’t have time for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I never thought that I would become the kind of person who accepts that my time or energy are limited, in my younger years I certainly looked down upon these people who acted all squishy and “human”, convinced in that common youthful ignorance that I was different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well as it turns out, I’m not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Particularly once I received the news that I would become a parent next year, and as I started to soak in all of the implications of that, I was forced to reckon with the fact that I too am a human being with limited abilities, limited time, and limited energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prioritization is the name of the game. If you don’t make intentional decisions about how that limited effort is spent, you just end up wasting it away on the wrong thing. And whilst I find it very difficult to say no to something, I’ve come to realize that the alternative is much worse: Going to sleep at night knowing you spent your day on the wrong thing, and that there are only so many of them left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I’ve made the decision to become more discerning about what exactly it is that I want to achieve, and carefully prioritize those tasks that further my goals, and not let myself get distracted with the rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;future&#34; &gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#future&#34;&gt;
        #
    &lt;/a&gt;
    Future…
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I look forward to 2024 and beyond, I’m reassured by something I once heard:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People chronically overestimate what can be done in a year, and underestimate what can be done in a lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s with that lens that I enter the new year, hopeful for our collective future. Knowing it will probably take more than 2024, I choose to focus on where we can get if we apply our collective humanity &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P.S. The world is &lt;strong&gt;still&lt;/strong&gt; absolutely breathtaking! Go out and take a look.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet - some of them almost certainly will in the new year, others may be abandoned for good.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Reflection on 2022</title>
      <link>/blog/a-reflection-on-2022/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 31 Dec 2022 18:24:30 -0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/blog/a-reflection-on-2022/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It is a well kept tradition to reflect on the year behind us as we slip past the longest winter night, the opulent holiday parties, and into a “new” year on the calendar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whilst I’m dubious of the idea that a new number on a calendar, in and of itself inspires any profound change in any of us, the practice of self reflection undoubtedly leads to better people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;return-to-the-web&#34; &gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#return-to-the-web&#34;&gt;
        #
    &lt;/a&gt;
    Return to the Web
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most significant effects the year of 2022 has had on me, is reigniting my passion for the World Wide Web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That might sound like an odd statement for someone like me to make. After all the technologies that underly the internet, and in turn the web, are how I make my living. One might argue that the internet is a significant portion of my identity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elon Musk’s purchase of Twitter in 2022 forced me, and others in the tech sphere, to face an uncomfortable reality we’ve been largely ignoring for the past decade: The web is losing it’s web-like fabric at an alarming rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through the consolidation of our attention among a short list of web properties, our favorite technology is undergoing the same evolution that can be observed by comparing historical cities with more recent developments: Rather than bustling and sprawling city centers, we see a few big-box stores, connected by Terabit per second network links. Despite being impressive in their own right, these all encompassing sites take away what made the web so special in its early years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s quite plausible that this evolution is the inevitable outcome of the web becoming commoditized, as the &lt;a href=&#34;https://public.tableau.com/views/InternetUse_update2022_14Nov/InternetUse1?%3Adisplay_count=y&amp;amp;%3Aembed=y&amp;amp;%3Aembed_code_version=3&amp;amp;%3Alanguage=en-US&amp;amp;%3AloadOrderID=0&amp;amp;%3Aorigin=viz_share_link&amp;amp;publish=yes&#34;&gt;number of internet users has grown 5 fold since the “good old days” of the internet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Nonetheless I feel inclined double down on my commitment to this wonderful technology, and platform, we all share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve taken two concrete steps to in furtherance of this goal:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elon’s leadership drove me to look for alternatives to Twitter. &lt;a href=&#34;https://joinmastodon.org/&#34;&gt;Mastodon&lt;/a&gt; was the obvious choice, given its federated nature. The move to Mastodon gave me a chance to bust out the sever admin chops, as I spun up a dedicated instance for my wife and I. Hosting my own social media site has been a breath of fresh air. Except that moment where I thought I’d hosed the server during a software update. If you’re into that sort of thing, I can be found at: &lt;a href=&#34;https://mastodon.mallegolhansen.com/@philip&#34;&gt;https://mastodon.mallegolhansen.com/@philip&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This blog post! Although I’ve had a personal website in one form or another for years, it’s been sparsely used. This site is the second half of the same strategy that underpins the personal Mastodon instance: A place on the web, owned and operated by myself, for my thoughts, projects, and anything else I want to share. Mastodon serves the short-form style traditionally served by other social media sites, and I intend to make better use of the site for those things that don’t fit in 500 characters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;life-is-short&#34; &gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#life-is-short&#34;&gt;
        #
    &lt;/a&gt;
    Life is Short
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Undoubtedly a trope we’ve all heard ad infinitum, 2022 provided me a stark reminder of how precious life is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My grandfather was one of the greatest role models in my life. He showed me the ways of woodworking in his workshop, how to navigate the world by map&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, how to put my body to work in the garden, how to architect and design changes to gardens or houses, and so much more. He had a significant role in shaping who I am today, by modeling passion for the thing he was working on, understanding that you never half-ass a project, knowing when to put the shovel down and call it a day, and doing all of that with a smile on his face. I miss him dearly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-world-is-breathtaking&#34; &gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#the-world-is-breathtaking&#34;&gt;
        #
    &lt;/a&gt;
    The World is Breathtaking
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whilst the U.S. has a plethora of issues about which countless books could be written, one thing it does not lack is beauty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year I was fortunate enough to spend a week camping in &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nps.gov/yell/index.htm&#34;&gt;Yellowstone National Park&lt;/a&gt; for my birthday, neither words nor images can describe the experience. All I can really say is: I highly recommend the experience to anyone who has the opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spending a week away from cellular reception, away from angry tweets, away from work emails, and the constant pressure of being a member of society, and simply existing in a space together with nature, and a handful of other people, felt in a way I have never felt before. I am certain that it’s a success I will want to reproduce in the future. Whilst my career, my hobbies, my friends, and most other things in my life have happened thanks to technology in one way or another, stepping back from it all made clear all the stress it brings as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although they cannot possibly do the experience justice, the pictures below are a small selection of the views of the trip, I hope they inspire you to see the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To me, that&amp;rsquo;s circa the mid-2000’s.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before GPS was commonly available that was how we got around.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
