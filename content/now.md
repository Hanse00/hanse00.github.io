If you want to know what's going on in my life [now](https://nownownow.com/about), this is the page for you.

## Where am I?

I'm in the U.S., specifically Washington — The state, not the city — near the city of Vancouver — [The one in Washington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vancouver,_Washington), that you probably haven't heard of, not the one in Canada, that you almost certainly have heard of.

We have a stereotypical suburban single-family, two-story, house, which I share with [my wife](http://jessica.mallegolhansen.com), our child, and two cats.

We've lived in the area for 5 years now, I became a U.S. Citizen last year, we're *probably* staying here for good, but the geopolitical landscape may yet throw a wrench in those plans. 

## Work

I'm on my 4th year of full time employment as a Senior Consultant at [Slalom](https://www.slalom.com/us/en/who-we-are/locations/portland).

The work varies from client to client of course, but in general my days are some mix of:

* Writing net-new software.
* Refactoring my client out of technical messes.
* Coaching engineering teams on practices like TDD, Continuous Integration, using Infrastructure as Code to build out systems, and a handful of related practices.

The vast majority of my days are spent at home in my office. Once in a while I travel into Portland or Seattle to get some face-to-face time with colleagues and clients.

## Parenting

My kid is just shy of a year old, it's a total whirlwind. I have never felt a more gratifying feeling than seeing a smile on their face, but I've also never been this tired.

Besides work, most days my energy is totally drained with the inevitable chores that come from being a parent.

## The Web

What little energy I do have left over, primarily goes into making this website, running my private [Mastodon instance](https://mastodon.mallegolhansen.com), serving as an admin of the [pdx.social](https://pdx.social) Mastodon instance, and otherwise experimenting with ways I can use the web to fulfill the promise of decentralized communication.
