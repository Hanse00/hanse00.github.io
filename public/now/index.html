            <h2>Where am I?</h2>
            <p>
                I’m in the U.S., specifically Washington &mdash; 
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)" hreflang="en">The state</a>,
                not <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C." hreflang="en">the city</a>
                &mdash; near the city of Vancouver &mdash;
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vancouver,_Washington" hreflang="en">The one in Washington</a>,
                that you probably haven't heard of. Not
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vancouver" hreflang="en">the one in Canada</a>,
                that you almost certainly <em>have</em> heard of.
            </p>
            <p>
                We have a stereotypical suburban single-family, two-story, house, which I share with my wife, our child, and two cats.
            </p>
            <p>
                We’ve lived in the area for 5 years now. I became a U.S. Citizen last year, we’re <em>probably</em> staying here for good, but the geopolitical landscape may yet throw a wrench in those plans.
            </p>
            <h2>Work</h2>
            <p>
                I’m on my 4th year of full time employment as a Senior Consultant at <a href="https://www.slalom.com/us/en/who-we-are/locations/portland" hreflang="en">Slalom</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                The work varies from client to client of course, but in general my days are some mix of:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Writing net-new software.</li>
                <li>Refactoring my client out of technical messes.</li>
                <li>Coaching engineering teams on practices like TDD, Continuous Integration, using Infrastructure as Code to build out systems, and a handful of related practices.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The vast majority of my days are spent at home in my office. Once in a while I travel into Portland or Seattle to get some face-to-face time with colleagues and clients.
            </p>
            <h2>Parenting</h2>
            <p>
                My kid is just over a year old, it’s a total whirlwind. I have never felt a more gratifying feeling than seeing a smile on their face, but I’ve also never been this tired.
                Besides work, most days my energy is totally drained with the inevitable chores that come from being a parent.
            </p>
            <h2>The Web</h2>
            <p>
                What little energy I do have left over, primarily goes into making this website, running my private <a href="https://mastodon.mallegolhansen.com/" hreflang="en">Mastodon instance</a>, serving as an admin of the <a href="https://pdx.social/" hreflang="en">pdx.social</a> Mastodon instance, and otherwise experimenting with ways I can use the web to fulfill the promise of decentralized communication.
