The topic of computer AI (Artificial Inteligence) has taken a foothold in the mainstream since [OpenAI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI) brought their [ChatGPT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT) service to the masses in late 2022.

For all the media attention that this topic is now getting, a lot of the conversation I hear betrays a total lack of fundamental understanding of the topic. I am by no means an expert, it's not the particular speciality that my own software engineering experience focuses on, but I understand enough of the basics to participate intelligently in the topic.

If you wish to achieve a similar "just enough" mastery of the topic, I can wholeheartedly recommend this series by YouTube channel [3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/@3blue1brown)[^1]:
